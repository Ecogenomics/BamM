        <h1>Get BamM</h1>
        <p>I use and love Linux and BamM has been developed to work on a Linux system. I'm not saying it won't work elsewhere, but I haven't tried. YMMV. People have successfully used BamM on many different flavours of Linux as well as on Mavericks 10.9. If you try it somewhere else then let me know. I'd like to keep this list up to date.</p>
        <p>The installation for BamM is a little more complicated than just using pip. Please see the <a href="manual/BamM_manual.pdf">manual</a> for detailed installation instructions, including dependencies.

        <h1>Use BamM</h1>
        <p>The primary motivation for building BamM was to replaace PySam in GroopM. Not saying PySam is bad, it's just that GroopM doesn't need all the PySam features and what it does need can be done way way faster in C-land.</p>
        <p>From there, BamM was developed to be used as a command line tool and as a python library. Detailed information on the former can be found in our new, ever more detailed <a href="manual/BamM_manual.pdf">manual</a>. To use BamM as a library check out the <a href="dev_docs/index.html">development api</a>. If you're feeling rushed then read on:</p>
        <p>BamM on the command line is run in three modes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>make</strong> - Make a bunch of BAM files by mapping several read sets against a common reference sequence</li>
          <li><strong>parse</strong> - Examine the BAMs to produce coverage profiles or linking information</li>
          <li><strong>extract</strong> - Extract reads that map to some given collections of contigs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>BamM was designed to be as parameter-free as possible. For more information on these steps type:</p>
        <p>$ bamm OPTION -h</p>
